The Web-Application Pen-Testing Resource

This repo is a intedned to be a resource to be called upon when undertaking penetration testing of web-applictions. It is a collection of tips, tricks, tools, tutorials, guides and cheat sheets. It is inspiraed by other such guides that can be found across he web and on Github, many of which will be linked to in the sources section of this resource.

The Web-Application Pen-Testing Resource (WAPTR) is intedned as a personal resource to pull together and keep track of various useful bits of information and tools etc that I find useful to keep around and have easy access to when performing web-app pen-tests. If others also find this resource useful, then great!

The WAPTR is still in very eary development, hence the pretty much complete lack of anything, besides this short introduction, that can be found here. But, rest assured, more will be coming shortly and this guide will continue to grow other the coming weeks and months.

For now, that is all, but remember;

Stay awesome! (and spaces not tabs!)
